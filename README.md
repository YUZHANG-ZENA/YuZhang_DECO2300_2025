Assignment 1.1: Design Report Concept - Procreate XR
Update date: 13/08/2025

1. Application
   Procreate (Category: Creation), a professional digital illustration and painting application.    

2. User Tasks and Goals
  a.	Immersive Drawing Experience
    Goal: Create freely on an expandable canvas without being restricted by screen size.
    Task: Use controllers or hand gestures to zoom, rotate, and move the canvas in space.

  b.	Layered Drawing
    Goal: Manage and refine complex artworks through separate editable layers.
    Task: Switch between layers, show/hide them, and edit each individually for detailed adjustments.

  c.	Real-world Preview
    Goal: Place and view the artwork in realistic environments for evaluation and presentation.
    Task: Adjust scale and position to preview artwork on billboards, posters, products, or street walls.

  d.	Projection Assistance
    Goal: Simulate projecting a sketch or artwork onto real-world surfaces such as walls or tables to             replace physical projectors.
    Task: Adjust transparency and scale through controllers, align the projection to the surface, and             use it as a guide for large-scale real-world painting or mural work.

3. Idea development process
  a.	Adapt Procreate for XR to allow drawing in a large, freeform canvas and added multi-layer         functionality for better control over complex artworks (Initial idea) 
  b.	Added real-world preview to help artists evaluate and present designs in realistic locations (Based on a review of existing products) 
  c.	Introduced projection assistance to support real-world mural and wall art creation without physical projectors (Based on week 2 studio lo-fi prototype test feedback)

4. Define the concept of Procreate in XR
   
Procreate XR will provide a fully spatial experience for digital art creation in a mixed reality environment, merging the physical environment with a virtual canvas. Users can create on an infinite canvas, take advantage of XR’s capabilities for more intuitive and efficient layer management, use virtual projection to assist real-world painting, and place their artwork directly into real-world contexts for preview and presentation. Procreate XR will support the following interactions:
  a.	Free Canvas
    Adjust and navigate the canvas using pinch, drag, and rotate gestures (or controllers).
  b.	Floating Layer Panel
    A floating menu that allows users to select, reorder, and toggle the visibility of layers.
  c.	Real-world Preview Mode
    Choose from preset scenes (billboards, posters, street walls, product packaging) or scan the real       environment to anchor the artwork onto physical objects. 
  d.	Projection Mode
    Overlay a semi-transparent version of the artwork onto any real-world surface, with adjustable          scale, position, and opacity.

5. Initial testing plans

  a.	Interactions and features to test
     •	Canvas zoom/rotate/move gestures (or controllers).
     •	Layer management (switching, editing, hiding).
     •	Projection mode’s accuracy, opacity control, and usability for real-world painting.
     •	Real-world preview placement accuracy and realism.

  b.	 Assumptions
    •	Users can intuitively navigate a spatial canvas with gestures or controllers.
    •	Projection assistance will be more practical and precise than traditional projectors.
    •	Real-world preview will improve creative decision-making and client presentations.

  c.	 Data collection and validation need
    •	Record Task completion time and error rates to validate the functionality is easy to use and supports efficient task performance.
    •	Record Usability ratings (e.g., SUS score) to validate whether the interactions are smooth, intuitive, and align with user expectations.
    •	Collect Qualitative user feedback on workflow and overall satisfaction to identify opportunities for improvement.
